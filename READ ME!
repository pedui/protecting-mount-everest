Hello there!
Here are some simple rules for making your own data files for the game:

1. As the game cannot handle thousands of enemies and sherpas swarming the level, the amount of characters
   per tent and enemy wave has been limited to 20. These waves are limited to 1 - 10 per level.

3. Always put in at least one defense spot and over 10 path coordinates in a Level file. The game will only
   work correctly when it has a path for the enemies, and the one defense spot is for the player's benefit.
   
4. The health of a character cannot be 0.0 at the start of a level.

5. The files inside the data folder have to be named correctly for the data reader to identify them.
	# Level files need to contain a space and the level number after the name, f.ex. "Level 1" or "Level 2".
	# Enemy files have to contain a space and the enemy type number after the name, f.ex. "Enemy 1".
	# Machine and Tent files are simply named "Tent" and "Machine". Try to have only one of each inside the
	folder to avoid any confusion with the data reader.

6. Lastly, remember to save the data file before launching the game!

Thank you for your patience! Feel free to check out the data folder in the project root.
Hope you enjoy the game!
